FEAT-SAVE-LOAD-DATA

NOTE

question for #design (after playtests?)
-what if all smudges started at a random size between 1 and 3ish? i.e. take 1-3 sprays to neutralize before wiping
  -only after tutorial
  -start at mostly 1, 2 is rare
  -next levels vary it more to be equal distribution between 1-3
